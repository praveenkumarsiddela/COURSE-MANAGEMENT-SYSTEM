# Course Management System

## Overview
A responsive web application designed to manage university courses. The system provides functionalities for user authentication, course management, and data visualization.

### Problem Statement
Traditional book exchange methods are often inefficient and inaccessible, relying on physical meetings or complex online platforms. This project aims to overcome these shortcomings by offering a digital platform where users can effortlessly list their books, explore available titles, and initiate exchanges, making the process convenient and accessible to a broader audience.

### Scope and Limitations
The project includes user authentication, book listing, and exchange functionalities. Users can register, log in, list books, browse titles, and initiate exchanges. However, the application does not handle physical book shipments or payments; it solely facilitates the exchange process by connecting users based on their preferences.

### Justification of the Technology Stack
The technology stack includes:
- **Node.js:** Server-side development
- **Express.js:** Web application framework
- **MongoDB:** Efficient data storage
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Server-side templating

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT.
- **Course Management**: Create, update, delete, and view courses.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures compatibility across devices.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit pull requests.

## API Specifications
The API follows RESTful principles for user authentication, book listing, and exchanges.

## Learning Outcomes
The project encapsulates various learning outcomes:
- Secure user interactions with authentication and authorization.
- Middleware implementation for request processing.
- Docker for containerization and deployment.
- Error handling and HTTP status codes in Node.js applications.
- Secure communication using SSL/TLS.
