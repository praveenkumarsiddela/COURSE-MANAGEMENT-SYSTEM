# Book Exchange Application

## Introduction

### Overview
The Book Exchange Application is designed to facilitate seamless book listing and exchanges among users. It prioritizes a smooth user experience, allowing users to register, manage passwords, list books, and exchange them with their peers. Built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, the application ensures scalability and maintainability by separating concerns effectively.

### Problem Statement
Traditional book exchange methods are often inefficient and inaccessible, relying on physical meetings or complex online platforms. This project aims to overcome these shortcomings by offering a digital platform where users can effortlessly list their books, explore available titles, and initiate exchanges, making the process convenient and accessible to a broader audience.

### Scope and Limitations
The project includes user authentication, book listing, and exchange functionalities. Users can register, log in, list books, browse titles, and initiate exchanges. However, the application does not handle physical book shipments or payments; it solely facilitates the exchange process by connecting users based on their preferences.

### Justification of the Technology Stack
The technology stack includes:
- **Node.js:** Server-side development
- **Express.js:** Web application framework
- **MongoDB:** Efficient data storage
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** Server-side templating

These technologies were chosen for their reliability, scalability, and user-friendly nature in web application development.


## API Specifications
The API follows RESTful principles for user authentication, book listing, and exchanges.

## Learning Outcomes
The project encapsulates various learning outcomes:
- Secure user interactions with authentication and authorization.
- Middleware implementation for request processing.
- Docker for containerization and deployment.
- Error handling and HTTP status codes in Node.js applications.
- Secure communication using SSL/TLS.
